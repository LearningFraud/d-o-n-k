    "Over the course of today, I have completed a bunch of pre-admin needed for me to continue with this project. During the approval stage I was told this is a \"Big Hairy Goal\", and that I \"need to set guard rails on my scope\". I have set up a PNR switch which will mean I abandon the ML aspect if I cannot get something functional by the end of Week 7. I am aware this is an ambitious project, I take this as a challenge, let's see what happens.\n",

    "Continued, I began testing on additional modules, especially ML which would need to work in Unity C#, which is a suboptimal ML language. Either that or I'd have to do the ML in Python and use some kind of interpreter to turn that directly to Assembly and use that as opposed to plug and play Unity C#.\n",
